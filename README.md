# dbWarden
 dbWarden is a SQL Server health monitoring toolkit, first appearing on SQL Server Central at http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Monitoring/98106/  The original author later put the code on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/dbwarden but it has not been updated since 2013. As such, it doesn't support AWS RDS, modern versions of SQL Server, etc.  There do not appear to be any more modern versions on the Internet, so I'm taking it on to get it up-to-date.
